# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## **Project Overview**  
Diabetes is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Common symptoms of diabetes include frequent urination, increased thirst, and hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can lead to serious complications, including diabetic ketoacidosis, stroke, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes.

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not, using a dataset derived from the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases**. The dataset focuses on female patients, at least 21 years old, of **Pima Indian heritage**.

## **Objective**  
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic features. The model will assist in early detection, helping healthcare professionals make timely decisions.

## **Dataset Details**  
The dataset contains several medical predictor variables and one target variable: **Outcome** (whether the patient has diabetes). Some of the key predictor variables include:  
- **Number of pregnancies**  
- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**  
- **Insulin level**  
- **Age**  
- **Blood Pressure**  
- **Glucose level**  
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function (a function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history)**

## **Data Preprocessing**  
- **Data Cleaning:**  
  - Handle missing values and outliers.  
  - Normalize/standardize features if necessary to improve model performance.  

- **Feature Selection:**  
  - Identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to predicting diabetes.  

---

## **Machine Learning Approach**  
Several machine learning algorithms will be tested, including:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC-AUC) curve.

---

## **Outcome**  
The model will be used to predict the likelihood of diabetes in a given patient, helping healthcare professionals make better diagnostic decisions. By analyzing the dataset's features, the model will identify patterns in the data and provide insights into the factors most strongly associated with diabetes.

---

## **Significance**  
This project aims to develop an early prediction system for diabetes, a condition that affects millions globally. Early diagnosis and intervention can prevent severe complications, improving patient quality of life and reducing healthcare costs.
